# Manual
This is basic manual for the program. It contains all informaiton which potential user might need to operate program an understand it's behaviour. This is not, however, an instruciton for debugging or furhter upgradibility of the program.

### Main purpose of the program
When I began making this project, my goal was to create a simple soultion which would allow user to simulate what a speciphic instruction does to an fivutal hardware (registers, stack, flags etc.). With this in mind, I've continued it's development as a topic fro my engineering thesis, therfore making is more advanced, and complient with requirements.
